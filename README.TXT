Basic java version of minesweeper.

Hardcoded ability to change the size of the window and how many mines are generated for that game.

**Update this upon fixing**
***************************

Need to fix:
-Empty space; auto show all touching 0 cells
-Empty space; edges, show index numbers
-Show index number after a button is clicked (image behind button?)
-Have Win/Lose text show over the original board field
-Resize controls with window resize
-Finish GUI and time counter
-Add click actions for the menu buttons

Need to add:
-Add 3 difficulties and a custom setting
-Maybe have the start default to a mode and then a file menu to adjust settings
-Add bomb graphics (index numbers alos?)
-Add button for reset without clearing the board

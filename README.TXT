Basic java version of minesweeper.


***************************
**Update this upon fixing**
***************************

Need to fix:
-Empty space; auto show all touching 0 cells
-Empty space; edges, show index numbers
-Resize controls with window resize (maybe dont have the ability to resize)
-Finish GUI and time counter

Need to add:
-Add bomb graphics (index numbers alos?)
-Add right click capability, one click flags it and decreases the shown mine count in GUI
-Possibly add color or theme settings

**Update this upon fixing**

Need to fix:
-Empty space; auto show all touching 0 cells
-Empty space; edges, show index numbers
-Show index number after a button is clicked (image behind button?)
-Have Win/Lose text show over the original board field


Need to add:
-Add a user main menu
-Add 3 difficulties and a custom setting
-Add top in game menu, maybe have the start default to a mode and then a file menu to adjust settings
-Add bomb graphics (index numbers alos?)
-Add progress GUI and time counter
-Add button for reset without clearing the board
